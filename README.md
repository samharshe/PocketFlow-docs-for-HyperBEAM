# Tutorial: HyperBEAM

HyperBEAM is software that lets computers join a network for **decentralized computing**, following the rules of the *AO-Core protocol*.
Think of it as building a global, shared supercomputer where *Messages* carry tasks and data, and specialized mini-applications called *Devices* perform the computational work.
This allows for flexible, scalable, and autonomous applications to run without a central authority.
